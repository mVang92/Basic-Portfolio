                Hello! After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Informations Systems at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls in 2015,
                I have been thinking about a career in Web Development. As technology plays such a large role in today's modern society, the search for talented 
                individuals is in great demand. 
            </p>
                <p>    
                I am very confident in myself to learn new skills and technologies so concepts can be made into a functional application. 
                With great interests in Web Development, my plan on learning new skills to develop innovative web applications to increase productivity and 
                efficiency throughout large companies and clients one day.
            </p>
            <p>
